I worked on this project locally, first.

This project was less having to do with HTML, CSS, or heavy Javascript logic (to an extent); and more so had to do with DOM Manipulation, module/function management, and bundling files. For now, the project has basic styling and basic HTML elements. I plan on adding more in the future, but I did the bare minimum of what was required to see how all of these technologies up to this point worked congruently.
